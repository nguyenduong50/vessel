          ABS RecordⓇ®, the online database for ABS vessel records, provides a
          listing of all vessels and offshore installations cur- rently in class
          with ABS, including appropriate class notations. Each listing contains
          the principal particulars of the vessel or installation and
          information on the machinery, hull, capacities, builder, owner and ABS
          survey particulars. The data- base also includes listings for vessels
          with load line statutory certificates that are not ABS classed plus
          information on stat- utory survey status to the extent authorized by
          the ship's flag administration.

        <p class="mb-4 text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Class suspensions, withdrawals and re-instatements are posted as they
          occur. Postings are done at the same time as ABS Survey Status is
          updated.
